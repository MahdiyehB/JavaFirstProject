This project is a java application that performs data processing tasks. It reads two CSV files and inserts the records into two MySQL database tables using datasource connections. It validates the records and uses multithreading to improve the performance. It uses Apache Common CSV for reading CSV files and Log4j for logging. It writes the invalid records to a json file. Also the project is documented with javadoc comments.
